While AI-generated code provides a convenient starting point, complete reliance on AI output still carries significant risks today. Particularly when learning a new field, it's better to start with official documentation. Once you have a basic understanding, engaging with AI can lead to better results and improved efficiency.

Recently, while working on issues like 'I18n,' 'custom 404 pages,' and 'Nuxt importing PrimeVue form errors,' I attempted to use various AI tools for help. However, their responses were consistently inadequate. In contrast, official documentation and traditional search engines proved much more valuable.

In summary, while AI is a powerful tool, over-dependence on it may actually hinder our productivity. While leveraging AI's capabilities, we shouldn't overlook other valuable resources.

Furthermore, even in areas where you have expertise, it's crucial not to skip fundamental checks and reviews.
